+ photohashing for replacing photos(needs implementation on client-side)
+ ignore geotagging of photos with no matching trackpoint
+ more efficient queries for query_wte and get_country(Don't ask for every Trackpoint if nothing has changed between the first and the last)
+ image2tag makes duplicate entries when images are duplicated
+ adding the "finishtext"(<done>true</done>) destroys the proper xml-encoding and removes CDATA-strings
+ order photos by date before uploading
+ replace 5000 variables with **kwargs when calling a function
+ log_functions needs createdate from contentfile.xml instead of default date from postgres
