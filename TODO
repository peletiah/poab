+ add more flickr-relevant input-fields to the creator-interface(image-title or country, image-description, tags,...)
+ photohashing for replacing photos(needs implementation on client-side)
+ ignore geotagging of photos with no matching trackpoint
+ more efficient queries for query_wte and get_country(Don't ask for every Trackpoint if nothing has changed between the first and the last)
